Eggdrop Core Settings
Last revised: April 17, 2003
    _____________________________________________________________________

                            Eggdrop Core Settings


  This file describes the syntax and all the settings of your Eggdrop
  configuration file. Please note that you don't need to set all of these
  variables to make your bot work properly.


  ##### EXECUTABLE PATH #####


  The first line in an Eggdrop configuration file should contain
  a fully qualified path to your Eggdrop executable. It has to be
  implemented in the way the example shows to make the config file
  work as a shell script.

  Example:

    #! /path/to/eggdrop


  ##### BASIC SETTINGS #####

  You can change the basic Eggdrop appearance and behavior in this section.


    set username "lamest"
      This setting defines the username the bot uses on IRC. This setting has
      no effect if an ident daemon is running on your bot's machine.


    set admin "Lamer <email: lamer@lamest.lame.org>"
      This setting defines which contact person should be shown in .status,
      /msg help, and other places. You really should include this information.


    set network "SomeIrcNetwork"
      This setting is used only for info to share with others on your botnet.
      Set this to the IRC network your bot is connected to.


    set timezone "EST"
      This setting defines which timezone is your bot in. It's used for internal
      routines as well as for logfile timestamping and scripting purposes.
      The timezone string specifies the name of the timezone and must be three
      or more alphabetic characters. For example, Central European Time(UTC+1)
      should be "CET".


    set offset "5"
      The offset setting specifies the time value to be added to the local
      time to get Coordinated Universal Time (UTC aka GMT). The offset is
      positive if the local timezone is west of the Prime Meridian and
      negative if it is east. The value (in hours) must be between -23 and
      23. For example, if the timezone is UTC+1, the offset is -1.


    set env(TZ) "$timezone $offset" (disabled by default)
      If you don't want to use the timezone setting for scripting purposes
      only, but instead everywhere possible, then use this setting.


    set my-hostname "virtual.host.com"
    set my-ip "99.99.0.0"
      If you're using virtual hosting (your machine has more than 1 IP), you
      may want to specify the particular IP to bind to. You can specify either
      by hostname or by IP. You may also want to set the hostname here if
      Eggdrop has trouble detecting it when it starts up.


    addlang "english"
      If you want to have your Eggdrop messages displayed in another language,
      change this command to match your preferences. An alternative would be
      to set the environment variable EGG_LANG to that value.

      Languages included with Eggdrop: Danish, English, French, Finnish,
      German.



  ##### LOG FILES #####

  Eggdrop is capable of logging various things, from channel chatter to
  partyline commands and file transfers.

  Logfiles are normally kept for 24 hours. Afterwards, they will be renamed
  to "(logfilename).yesterday". After 48 hours, they will be overwritten by
  the logfile of the next day.


    set max-logs 5
      This is the maximum number of logfiles allowed. This setting can be
      increased; however, don't decrease it.


    set max-logsize 0
      This is the maximum size of your logfiles. Set it to 0 to disable.
      This value is in kilobytes, so '550' would mean cycle logs when it
      reaches the size of 550 kilobytes. Note that this only works if you
      have keep-all-logs set to 0 (OFF).


    set quick-logs 0
      This could be good if you have had a problem with logfiles filling
      your quota/hard disk or if you log +p and publish it to the web, and
      you need more up-to-date info. Note that this setting might increase
      the CPU usage of your bot (on the other hand it will decrease your RAM
      usage).

    set raw-log 0
      This setting allows you the logging of raw incoming server traffic via
      console/log flag 'r', raw outgoing server traffic via console/log mode
      'v', raw botnet traffic via console/log mode 't', and raw share traffic
      via console/log mode 'h'. These flags can create a large security hole,
      allowing people to see user passwords. This is now restricted to +n users
      only. Please choose your owners with care.

  logfile <logflags> <channel> "logs/logfile"
      This setting tells the bot what should be logged, from where, and to
      which file.

      Logfile flags:
        b - information about bot linking and userfile sharing
        c - commands
        d - misc debug information
        h - raw share traffic
        j - joins, parts, quits, and netsplits on the channel
        k - kicks, bans, and mode changes on the channel
        m - private msgs, notices and ctcps to the bot
        o - misc info, errors, etc (IMPORTANT STUFF)
        p - public text on the channel
        r - raw incoming server traffic
        s - server connects, disconnects, and notices
        t - raw botnet traffic
        v - raw outgoing server traffic
        w - wallops (make sure the bot sets +w in init-server)
        x - file transfers and file-area commands

      Note that modes d, h, r, t, and v can fill disk quotas quickly. There are
      also eight user-defined levels (1-8) which can be used by Tcl scripts.

      Each logfile belongs to a certain channel. Events of type 'k', 'j', and
      'p' are logged to whatever channel they happened on. Most other events
      are currently logged to every channel. You can make a logfile belong to
      all channels by assigning it to channel "*".

      Examples:

      logfile mco * "logs/eggdrop.log"
      logfile jpk #lamest "logs/lamest.log"

      In 'eggdrop.log', put private msgs/ctcps, commands, misc info, and errors
      from any channel.

      In 'lamest.log', log all joins, parts, kicks, bans, public chatter, and
      mode changes from #lamest.


    set log-time 1
      Use this feature to timestamp entries in the log file.


    set timestamp-format "[%H:%M:%S]"
      Set the following to the timestamp for the logfile entries. Popular times
      might be "[%H:%M]" (hour, min), or "[%H:%M:%S]" (hour, min, sec).
      Read `man strftime' for more formatting options.  Keep it below 32 chars.


    set keep-all-logs 0
      If you want to keep your logfiles forever, turn this setting on. All
      logfiles will get the suffix
      ".[day, 2 digits][month, 3 letters][year, 4 digits]". Note that your
      quota/hard-disk might be filled by this, so check your logfiles
      often and download them.


    set switch-logfiles-at 300
      You can specify when Eggdrop should switch logfiles and start fresh.
      use military time for this setting. 300 is the default, and describes
      03:00 (AM).


    set quiet-save 0
      "Writing user file..." and "Writing channel file..." messages won't be
      logged anymore if this option is enabled. If you set it to 2, the
      "Backing up user file..." and "Backing up channel file..." messages will
      also not be logged. In addition to this, you can disable the "Switching
      logfiles..." and the new date message at midnight, by setting this to 3.


    set logfile-suffix ".%d%b%Y"
      If keep-all-logs is 1, this setting will define the suffix of the
      logfiles. The default will result in a suffix like "04May2000". "%Y%m%d"
      will produce the often used yyyymmdd format. Read the strftime manpages
      for more options. NOTE: On systems which don't support strftime, the
      default format will be used _always_.



  ##### CONSOLE #####

    set console "mkcobxs"
      This is the default console mode. It uses the same event flags as the
      log files do. The console channel is automatically set to your "primary"
      channel, which is set in the modules section of the config file. Masters
      can change their console channel and modes with the '.console' command.



  ##### FILES AND DIRECTORIES #####

    set userfile "LamestBot.user"
      Specify here the filename your userfile should be saved as.


    set pidfile "pid.LamestBot"
      Specify here the filename Eggdrop will save its pid to. If no pidfile is
      specified, pid.(botnet-nick) will be used.


    set sort-users 0
      If you want your userfile to be sorted upon saving, enable this setting.
      This causes the bot to use a bit more CPU when saving the userfile.


    set help-path "help/"
      Specify here where Eggdrop should look for help files. Don't modify this
      setting unless you know what you're doing!


    set text-path "text/"
      Specify here where Eggdrop should look for text files. This is used for
      certain Tcl and DCC commands.


    set temp-path "/tmp"
      Set here a place to store temporary files.


    set motd "text/motd"
      The MOTD (Message Of The day) is displayed when people dcc chat or telnet
      to the bot. Look at doc/TEXT-SUBSTITUTIONS for options.


    set telnet-banner "text/banner"
      This banner will be displayed on telnet connections. Look at
      doc/text-substitutions.doc for options.


    set userfile-perm 0600
      This specifies what permissions the user, channel, and notes files should
      be set to. The octal values are the same as for the chmod system command.

      To remind you:

            u  g  o           u  g  o           u  g  o
      0600  rw-------   0400  r--------   0200  -w-------    u - user
      0660  rw-rw----   0440  r--r-----   0220  -w--w----    g - group
      0666  rw-rw-rw-   0444  r--r--r--   0222  -w--w--w-    o - others

      Note that the default 0600 is the most secure one and should only be
      changed if you need your files for shell scripting or other external
      applications.


    set mod-path "modules/"
      This path specifies the path were Eggdrop should look for its modules.
      If you run the bot from the compilation directory, you will want to set
      this to "". If you use 'make install' (like all good kiddies do ;), this
      is a fine default. Otherwise, use your head :).



  ##### BOTNET/DCC/TELNET #####

  Settings in this section should be unimportant for you until you deal with
  botnets (multiple Eggdrops connected together to maximize efficiency). You
  should read doc/BOTNET before modifying these settings.


    set botnet-nick "LlamaBot" (disabled by default)
      If you want to use a different nickname on the botnet than you use on
      IRC (i.e. if you're on an un-trusted botnet), un-comment this line
      and set it to the nick you would like to use.


    listen <port> <mode>
      This opens a telnet port by which you and other bots can interact with
      the Eggdrop by telneting in.

      There are more options for the listen command in doc/tcl-commands.doc.
      Note that if you are running more than one bot on the same machine, you
      will want to space the telnet ports at LEAST 5 apart, although 10 is even
      better.

      Valid ports are typically anything between 1025 and 65535 assuming the
      port is not already in use.

      If you would like the bot to listen for users and bots in separate ports,
      use the following format:

        listen 3333 bots
        listen 4444 users

      If you wish to use only one port, use this format:

        listen 3333 all

      You need to un-comment this line and change the port number in order to
      open the listen port. You should not keep this set to 3333.


    set remote-boots 2
      This setting defines whether or not people can boot users on the Eggdrop
      from other bots in your botnet. Valid settings are:
      0 - allow *no* outside boots
      1 - allow boots from sharebots
      2 - allow any boots


    set share-unlinks 1
      This setting prohibits Eggdrop to unlink from share bots if an remote
      bots tells so.


    set protect-telnet 0
      This setting will drop telnet connections not matching a known host.


    set dcc-sanitycheck 0
      This setting will make the bot ignore DCC chat requests which appear to
      have bogus information on the grounds that the user may have been trying
      to make the bot connect to somewhere that will get it into trouble, or
      that the user has a broken client, in which case the connect wouldn't
      work anyway.


    set ident-timeout 5
      This settings defines a time in seconds that the bot should wait before
      a dcc chat, telnet, or relay connection times out.


    set require-p 0
      Define here whether or not a +o user still needs the +p flag to dcc the
      bot.


    set open-telnets 0
      If you want people allow to telnet in and type 'NEW' to become a new user,
      set this to 1. This is similar to the 'hello' msg command. The
      protect-telnet setting must be set to 0 to use this.


    set stealth-telnets 0
      If you don't want Eggdrop to identify itself as an Eggdrop on a telnet
      connection, set this setting to 1. Eggdrop will display 'Nickname'
      instead.


    set use-telnet-banner 0
      If you want Eggdrop to display a banner when telneting in, set this
      setting to 1. The telnet banner is set by 'set telnet-banner'.


    set connect-timeout 15
      This settings defines a time in seconds that the bot should wait before
      a dcc chat, telnet, or relay connection times out.


    set dcc-flood-thr 3
      Specify here the number of lines to accept from a user on the partyline
      within 1 second before they are considered to be flooding and therefore
      get booted.


    set telnet-flood 5:60
      Define here how many telnet connection attempts in how many seconds from
      the same host constitute a flood. The correct format is Attempts:Seconds.


    set paranoid-telnet-flood 1
      If you want telnet-flood to apply even to +f users, set this setting
      to 1.


    set resolve-timeout 15
      Set here the amount of seconds before giving up on hostname/address
      lookup (you might want to increase this if you are on a slow network).



  ##### MORE ADVANCED SETTINGS #####

    set firewall "!sun-barr.ebay:3666"
      Set this to your socks host if your Eggdrop sits behind a firewall. If
      you use a Sun "telnet passthru" firewall, prefix the host with a "!".


    set nat-ip "127.0.0.1"
      If you have a NAT firewall (you box has an IP in one of the following
      ranges: 192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255, 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255,
      10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 and your firewall transparently changes your
      address to a unique address for your box) or you have IP masquerading
      between you and the rest of the world, and /dcc chat, /ctcp chat or
      userfile sharing aren't working, enter your outside IP here. This IP
      is used for transfers only, and has nothing to do with the my-ip or
      my-hostname settings. You may still need to set my-ip and/or my-hostname.


    set reserved-portrange 2010:2020
      If you want all dcc file transfers to use a particular portrange either
      because you're behind a firewall, or for other security reasons, set it
      here.


    set ignore-time 15
      Set the time in minutes that temporary ignores should last.


    set hourly-updates 00
      Define here what Eggdrop considers 'hourly'. All calls to it, including
      such things as note notifying or userfile saving, are affected by this.

      Example:

        set hourly-updates 15

      The bot will save its userfile 15 minutes past every hour.


    set owner "MrLame, MrsLame"
      Un-comment this line and set the list of owners of the bot.
      You NEED to change this setting.


    set notify-newusers "$owner"
      Who should a note be sent to when new users are learned?


    set default-flags "hp"
      Enter the flags that all new users should get by default. See '.help
      whois' on the partyline for a list of flags and their descriptions.


    set whois-fields "url birthday"
      Enter all user-defined fields that should be displayed in a '.whois'.
      This will only be shown if the user has one of these extra fields.
      You might prefer to comment this out and use the userinfo1.0.tcl script
      which provides commands for changing all of these.


    set die-on-sighup 0
      Enable this setting if you want your Eggdrop to die upon receiving a
      SIGHUP kill signal. Otherwise, the Eggdrop will just save its userfile
      and rehash.


    set die-on-sigterm 0
      Enable this setting if you want your Eggdrop to die upon receiving a
      SIGTERM kill signal. Otherwise, the Eggdrop will just save its userfile
      and rehash.


    unbind dcc n tcl *dcc:tcl
    unbind dcc n set *dcc:set
      Comment these two lines if you wish to enable the .tcl and .set commands.
      If you select your owners wisely, you should be okay enabling these.


    set must-be-owner 1
      If you enable this setting, only permanent owners (owner setting) will
      be able to use .tcl and .set. Moreover, if you want to only let permanent
      owners use .dump, then set this to 2.


    unbind dcc n simul *dcc:simul
      Comment out this line to add the 'simul' partyline command (owners
      can manipulate other people on the party line). Please select owners
      wisely and use this command ethically!


    set max-dcc 50
      Set here the maximum number of dcc connections you will allow. You can
      increase this later, but never decrease it.


    set allow-dk-cmds 1
      Enable this setting if you want +d & +k users to use commands bound
      as -|-.


    set dupwait-timeout 5
      If your Eggdrop rejects bots that actually have already disconnected
      from another hub, but the disconnect information has not yet spread
      over the botnet due to lag, use this setting. The bot will wait
      dupwait-timeout seconds before it checks again and then finally
      reject the bot.


    set strict-host 1
      Set this to 0 if you want the bot to strip '~+-^=' characters from
      user@hosts before matching them. This setting is currently kept for
      compatibility, but will be removed from the next release. Please leave
      it set to 1 for now to avoid problems with your user files in the future.


    set cidr-support 0
      Enables cidr support for b/e/I modes if set to 1. This means the bot
      will understand and match modes in cidr notation, and will be able to
      put and enforce such bans or unban itself, if banned with a cidr mask.
      Do NOT set this, if your network/server does not support cidr!


  ##### MODULES #####

  After the core settings, you should start loading modules. Modules are
  loaded by the command "loadmodule <module>". Eggdrop looks for modules
  in the directory you specified by the module-path setting in the files
  and directories section.

  Please note that for different configurations, different modules are needed.
  Four examples:

    Channel Security Bot:
      This bot needs the channels, blowfish, console, dns, irc, and (if you
      like) ctcp modules loaded. More is not needed and makes the bot slower.

    Public IRC Bot:
      A public bot should have all modules available loaded since they provide
      all functions for everyday use.

    Secure Filesys Bot:
      This bot needs all normal IRC operating modules, but not the notes, seen,
      ctcp or share modules.

    Limbo Bot:
      A limbo bot (serves as a botnet hub outside IRC) just needs the
      channels, console, dns, and maybe notes or share modules loaded. Of
      course, blowfish needs to be loaded here, too.



  ##### SCRIPTS #####

  The scripts section should be placed at the end of the config file. All
  modules should be loaded and their variables should be set at this point.

    source scripts/script.tcl
      This line loads script.tcl from the scripts directory inside your
      Eggdrop's directory. All scripts should be put there, although you can
      place them where you like as long as you can supply a fully qualified
      path to them.

      Some commonly loaded scripts are alltools.tcl and action.fix.tcl.

      The appropriate source lines are:

        source scripts/alltools.tcl
        source scripts/action.fix.tcl
