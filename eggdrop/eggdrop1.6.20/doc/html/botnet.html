    <blockquote>
      <p>The following are some common terms used in this document:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Botnet</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A botnet consists of one or more bots connected together.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Link</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Link is the term used to describe a bot connecting to another
          bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Hub</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A bot is described as a hub-bot if one or more bots are linked
          to it.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Leaf</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A leaf is a non-hub bot connecting to a hub-bot. A leaf has
          only one other bot connected to it, its hub. Leaf bots can be
          assigned the &quot;l&quot; botflag to prevent other bots from
          linking to them.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Link Bot</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A link-bot is a bot that is linked to another bot. It may or
          may not be a hub-bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Share</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Share is the term used to describe the sharing of user records.
          </p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Share Bot</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A share-bot is a bot which shares user records with one or more
          linked bots.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Aggressive Share</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Aggressive share is a term used to describe the direction of
          sharing user-files. Aggressive share bots will SEND userfiles to
          another passive bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Passive Share</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Passive share is a term used to describe the direction of
          sharing user-files. Passive share bots will accept userfiles from
          an aggressive share bot.</p>

          <p>Example bottree:</p>

<pre>
     BotA
       |-+BotB
         `-+BotC
</pre>


          <p>BotB is linked to a master sharebot, BotA, and a slave
          sharebot, BotC. BotB shares passively with &#91;receives from&#93;
          BotA and shares aggressively with &#91;sends to&#93; BotC.</p>
       </dd>

        <dt><strong>Flags</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Flags are attributes that determine what a bot can or is
          allowed to do. Flags can be either global (such as +s) or channel
          specific (such as |+s #lamest). See &#39;.help botattr&#39; for
          help with setting these flags.</p>

    <p><a name="sect2"></a><strong>What is a botnet?</strong></p>

    <p>A botnet consists of one or more bots linked together. This can allow
    bots to op each other securely, control floods efficiently, and share
    user lists, ban lists, exempt/invite lists, and ignore lists (if sharing
    is enabled).</p>

    <p><a name="sect3"></a><strong>Adding and linking bots</strong></p>

    <p>With the common terms out of the way, we can start with the process of
    linking two bots. Before you start, you need to know the address and
    port of each bot you wish to link. Here is an example scenario:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>BotA is on lame.org listening on port 3333, and BotB is on irc.org
      listening on port 4444. First, you have to add each Bot to the other&#39;s
      userfile. On BotA, you would type &#39;.+bot BotB irc.org:4444&#39;.
      If BotB is on a common channel with BotA, BotB&#39;s hostmask is
      automatically added. Otherwise, you have to add the hostmask manually
      with the &#39;.+host&#39; command. On BotB, you would type &#39;.+bot
      BotA lame.org:3333&#39;.</p>

      <p>At this point, you can link the two bots by typing &#39;.link
      BotA&#39; on BotB (or &#39;.link BotB&#39; on BotA). The bots will
      now give themselves random passwords which are <strong>not</strong>
      stored encrypted in the userfile. Note that you can link as many bots
      as you wish to your botnet.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect3"></a><strong>Using botflags</strong></p>

    <p>Botflags are needed to assign special functions and tasks to your
    bots. Bot flags are set with the &#39;.botattr&#39; command. See
    &#39;.help botattr&#39; for help with this command. The following is
    a list of botflags and their functions:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>&quot;h&quot; (hub)</strong></p>

      <p>If you want your bot(s) to automatically link/relink, you can
      assign the +h botflag each bot&#39;s hub. Note that if you set
      multiple bots +h, the bot only attempts to link to one.</p>


      <p><strong>&quot;a&quot; (alternate)</strong></p>

      <p>If your bots are, for some reason, unable to link to their hub,
      they will attempt to connect to an alternate hub. You can assign a
      bot as an alternate hub by giving it the +a botflag.</p>


      <p><strong>&quot;l&quot; (leaf)</strong></p>

      <p>This flag, assigned to a link bot, will prevent the link bot from
      linking other bots to your botnet.</p>


      <p><strong>&quot;r&quot; (reject)</strong></p>

      <p>If you assign this flag to a link bot, the link bot will not be
      allowed to link to the botnet.</p>


      <p><strong>&quot;i&quot; (isolate)</strong></p>

      <p>This flag isolates a link bot&#39;s partyline from the rest of the
      botnet. Anything said on the link bot&#39;s partyline won&#39;t appear
      on the rest of the botnet.</p>


      <p><strong>&quot;s&quot;  (SEND userfile to)</strong></p>

      <p>+s -  Giving a link bot this flag will make the bot share
      aggressively with the link bot. See &#39;Aggressive Share&#39; in the
      &#39;Terms&#39; section of this document for more information on
      aggressive sharing.</p>

      <p>|s -  +s bots need this flag for each channel you want to share.
      </p>


      <p><strong>&quot;p&quot; (ACCEPT userfile from)</strong></p>

      <p>Giving a link bot this flag will make the bot share passively
      with the link bot. See &#39;Passive Share&#39; in the &#39;Terms&#39;
      section of this document for more information on passive sharing.</p>


      <p><strong>&quot;g&quot; (global share)</strong></p>

      <p>This flag allows the sharing of all channels with a link bot.</p>


      <p><strong>&quot;0-9&quot; (user-defined)</strong></p>

      <p>These 10 flags are user-defined can be used by scripters.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect4"></a><strong>Making bots share user records</strong></p>


    <p>Before you start preparing your bots for sharing, make sure that
    you&#39;ve loaded the transfer and share modules. You also have to
    ensure that each channel you wish to share is set +shared (see
    &#39;.help  chanset&#39; and &#39;.help chaninfo&#39;).</p>

    <p>By using specific botflags, you can cause your bot to share
    aggressively with some link bots, and passively with others. For
    sharing to work, flags must be set properly on both the passive and
    the aggressive bots. An aggressive  bot will not share userfiles with
    another aggressive bot; a passive bot will not share userfiles with
    another passive bot.</p>

    <p>First off, let&#39;s say we have two bots we want to link. We will
    call one Lamestbot, and the other Lameshare. The first thing that needs
    to be done is each bot needs the other bot added to it&#39;s user record.
    Your botnet should have a hub bot. This will have them connect
    automatically whenever they are started. Without a hub, you would have to
    manually link them with the .link command. For this situation we will
    make Lamestbot the hub for our small botnet. Let&#39;s also use a channel
    called #eggdrop as the one we want to share user channel flags with. Do
    the following:</p>

    <p>On Lamestbot:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>.+bot Lameshare eggdrop.com:3333 (This command adds a user record to
      Lamestbot for Lameshare. Lameshare is running from eggdrop.com and is
      on port 3333. If Lameshare were to have a separate port for
      users/relays we would just add a &#39;/&#39; and the port number, i.e.
      3333/5555.)</p>

      <p>.botattr Lameshare +s (This tells us that Lamestbot will only send
      user files to Lameshare; Lameshare will not send them to it.)</p>

      <p>.botattr Lameshare |s #eggdrop (this sets up sharing of the channel
      flags for #eggdrop between the bots. Without this, they will not share
      channel flags only global flags for the users.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On Lameshare:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>.+bot Lamestbot best.com:3333/5555 (Again this will add a user on
      Lameshare called Lamestbot with the domain of best.com. The bot has two
      ports, 3333 for bot communications and 5555 for users/relays.)</p>

      <p>.botattr Lamestbot +hp (This command sets Lamestbot as the hub and
      also as a passive share, which means Lameshare will accept user files
      from Lamestbot.</p>

      <p>.botattr Lamestbot |s #eggdrop (This sets #eggdrop as a share
      channel.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Our botnet:</p>

<pre>
     Lamestbot
       `-+Lameshare
</pre>

    <p>Let&#39;s add a third bot called beldin to this scenario:</p>

    <p>On Lamestbot:</p>

    <blockquote>
      .+bot beldin llama.com:3333

      <p>.botattr beldin s|s #eggdrop (Notice how i piped (the | character)
      the channel flag also saving time.)</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Also note that you don&#39;t have to add beldin on Lameshare. Since
    they are already sharing, it was added automatically. The one thing that
    you should note is that no bot flags will be shared. If you set beldin as
    +s (Aggressive share) on the hub (Lamestbot) he will not be set on the
    other bots as that. The same with the channel +s flag. All other flags
    will be shared such as the o, f, etc. Now that we have three bots, we
    can also set up one as an alternate hub. The alternate hub is the bot
    that the bots will auto-connect to in the event the hub goes down or
    is unreachable.</p>

    <p>Let&#39;s make beldin an alternate hub for our little botnet.</p>

    <p>On Lameshare:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>.botattr beldin +a</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>That&#39;s all there is to it. Again, since bot flags are not shared,
    you would have to add the bot flag +a for beldin on them all. The only
    ones you would not have to do this on are beldin and the hub (Lamestbot).
    Of course, if you had more bots, you would have to add beldin as a +a on
    them, but you would not do it on the hub or beldin.</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>Our botnet:</p>

<pre>
     Lamestbot
       |-+beldin
       `-+Lameshare
