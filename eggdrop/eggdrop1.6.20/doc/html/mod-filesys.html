    <p>This module provides an area within the bot where users can store and
    manage files. With this module, the bot is useable as a file server.</p>

      <p>This module provides the filesys support. You have to load this if
      you want your users to upload and download files from your bot.</p>

      <p>Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the
      filesys module:</p>

      <p><strong>loadmodule filesys</strong></p>

      <p>There are also some variables you can set in your config
      file:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>set files-path &quot;/home/mydir/eggdrop/filesys&quot;
        </strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the &#39;root&#39; directory for the file system.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set incoming-path
        &quot;/home/mydir/eggdrop/filesys/incoming&quot;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you want to allow uploads, set this to the directory uploads
          should be put into. Set this to &quot;&quot; if you don&#39;t want
          people to upload files to your bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set upload-to-pwd 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you don&#39;t want to have a central incoming directory,
          but instead want uploads to go to the current directory that a
          user is in, set this setting to 1.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set filedb-path &quot;&quot;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Eggdrop creates a &#39;.filedb&#39; file in each subdirectory
          of your file area to keep track of its own file system information.
          If you can&#39;t do that (for example, if the dcc path isn&#39;t
          owned by you, or you just don&#39;t want it to do that) specify
          a path here where you&#39;d like all of the database files to be
          stored instead.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-file-users 20</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the maximum number of people that can be in the file
          area at once. Setting this to 0 makes it effectively infinite.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-filesize 1024</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the maximum allowable file size that will be received
          (in KB). Setting this to 0 makes it effectively infinite.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
