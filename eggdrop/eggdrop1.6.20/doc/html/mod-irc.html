    <hr>

    <p>This module controls the bots interaction on IRC. It allows the bot to
    join channels, etc. You have to load this if you want your bot to come on
    IRC.</p>

        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set bounce-exempts 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set this to 1 if you want to bounce all server exemptions
          (+e modes). This is disabled if use-exempts is disabled.</p>
        </dd>

        <dd>
          <p>Set this to 1 if you want to bounce all server invitations

          <p>Set this to 1 if you want to bounce all server modes.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-modes 30</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>There is a global limit for +b/+e/+I modes. This limit should be
          set to the same value as max-bans for networks that do not support
          +e/+I.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-bans 20</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the maximum number of bans you want the bot to set on a
          channel. Eggdrop will not place any more bans if this limit is
          reached. Undernet currently allows 45 bans, IRCnet allows 30, EFnet
          allows 100, and DALnet allows 100.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-exempts 20</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the maximum number of exempts you want Eggdrop to set
          on a channel. Eggdrop will not place any more exempts if this
          limit is reached.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-invites 20</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the maximum number of invites you want Eggdrop to set
          on a channel. Eggdrop will not place any more invites if this
          limit is reached.</p>

        set use-invites 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>These settings should be left commented unless the default values
          are being overridden. By default, exempts and invites are on for
          EFnet and IRCnet, but off for all other large networks. This behavior
          can be modified with the following 2 flags. If your network
          doesn&#39;t support +e/+I modes then you will be unable to use these
          features.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set kick-fun 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set this to 1 if you want the bot to kick for control
          character/ctcp avalanches to a channel. Remember that if it does,
          it won&#39;t ban them. This can start kick floods.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set ban-fun 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set this to 1 if you want the bot to ban for control
          character/ctcp avalanches to a channel. This can prevent kick
          floods, but it also can fill the banlist.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set learn-users 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you want people to be able to add themselves to the bot&#39;s
          userlist with the default userflags (defined above in the config
          file) via the &#39;hello&#39; msg command, set this to 1.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set wait-split 300</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the time (in seconds) to wait for someone to return
          from a netsplit (i.e. wasop will expire afterwards). Set this to
          1500 on IRCnet since it&#39;s nick delay stops after 30 minutes.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set wait-info 15</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the time (in seconds) that someone must have been
          off-channel before re-displaying their info line.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set mode-buf-length 200</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set this to the maximum number of bytes to send in the
          arguments of modes sent to the server. Most servers default this
          to 200.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set opchars &quot;@&quot;<br>
        #set opchars &quot;@&~&quot;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Some IRC servers are using some non-standard op-like channel
          prefixes/modes. Define them here so the bot can recognize them. Just
          &quot;@&quot; should be fine for most networks. Un-comment the second
          line for some UnrealIRCds.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>unbind msg - hello *msg:hello<br>
        bind msg - myword *msg:hello</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Many IRCops find bots by seeing if they reply to &#39;hello&#39;
          in a msg. You can change this to another word by un-commenting the
          these two lines and changing &quot;myword&quot; to the word wish
          to use instead of &#39;hello&#39;. It must be a single word.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>unbind msg - ident *msg:ident<br>
        unbind msg - addhost *msg:addhost</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Many takeover attempts occur due to lame users blindly /msg
          ident&#39;ing to the bot and attempting to guess passwords. We now
          unbind this command by default to discourage them. You can enable
          this command by un-commenting these two lines.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set no-chanrec-info 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you are so lame you want the bot to display peoples info
          lines even when you are too lazy to add their chanrecs to a
          channel, set this to 1.</p>

          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This means <strong>every</strong> user
          with an info line will have their info line displayed on EVERY
          channel they join (provided they have been gone longer than
          wait-info).</p>

      <p>These were the core irc module settings. There are more settings for
      &#39;net-type&#39; 1 and 5. net-type has to be set in the server module
      config section.</p>

      <p><strong>Use the following settings only if you set &#39;net-type&#39;
      to 1!</strong></p>

          <p>At the moment, the current IRCnet IRCd version (2.10) doesn&#39;t
          support the mixing of b, o and v modes with e and I modes. This might
          be changed in the future, so use 1 at the moment for this setting.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>set kick-method 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If your network supports more users per kick command then 1,
          you can change this behavior here. Set this to the number of
          users to kick at once, or set this to 0 for all at once.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set modes-per-line 3</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Some networks allow you to stack lots of channel modes into
          one line. They&#39;re all guaranteed to support at least 3, so
          that&#39;s the default. If you know your network supports more,
          you may want to adjust this. This setting is limited to 6,
          although if you want to use a higher value, you can modify this
          by changing the value of MODES_PER_LINE_MAX in src/chan.h and
          recompiling the bot.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set include-lk 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Some networks don&#39;t include the +l limit and +k or -k key modes
          in the modes-per-line (see above) limitation. Set include-lk to 0
          for these networks.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set use-354 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set this to 1 if your network uses IRCu2.10.01 specific /who
          requests. Eggdrop can, therefore, ask only for exactly what&#39;s
          needed.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set rfc-compliant 1</strong> (Disabled by default)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If your network doesn&#39;t use rfc 1459 compliant string
          matching routines, set this to 0.</p>
