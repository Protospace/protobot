      <p><strong>Weird Messages That Get Logged</strong></p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <p>Shown below are some messages that Eggdrop might log from time to time
    that may seem a bit strange and have meanings which may not be obvious</p>

    <p><strong>(!) timer drift -- spun N minutes</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This is caused by one of several known things...</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Your bot could have been swapped out of memory for a while, or for
          some reason the computer could have stopped letting the bot run. Once
          a minute, Eggdrop does a few maintenance things, including counting
          down any active Tcl timers. If for some reason, several minutes pass
          without Eggdrop being able to do this, it logs this message to let
          you know what happened. It&#39;s generally a bad thing, because it means
          that the system your bot is on is very busy, and the bot can hardly
          keep track of the channel very well when it gets swapped out for
          minutes at a time.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>On some systems (at least Linux), if the DNS your bot is using to
          lookup hostnames is broken and *very* slow in responding (this can
          occur if the DNS server&#39;s uplink doesn&#39;t exist), then you
          will get 4-5 minute timer drifts continuously. This can be fixed by
          loading the dns module.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>The clock on your machine has just been changed. It may have been
          running behind by several minutes and was just corrected.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p><strong>(!) killmember(Nickname) -&gt; nonexistant</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>We have yet to track this down. It&#39;s a mildly bad thing, however.
      It means the bot just got informed by the server that someone left the
      channel -- but the bot has no record of that person ever being ON the
      channel.</p>

      <p><a href="mailto:jwilkinson@mail.utexas.edu">
      jwilkinson@mail.utexas.edu</a> had some insight into this one:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>This is not an Eggdrop bug, at least not most of the time. This is a
        bug in all but perhaps the very latest ircd systems. It&#39;s not
        uncommon during netsplits and other joins for the server to lose track
        of killed or collided join notices. Also, in some servers, it is
        possible to specify non-standard characters, such as carret symbols,
        which get falsely interpreted as capital letters.</p>


        <p>When converted to lowercase, these symbols fail to get processed,
        and joins are not reported, although parts are.</p>
