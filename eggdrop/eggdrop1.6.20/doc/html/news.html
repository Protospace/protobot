    <p><strong>News - Last revised: April 16, 2003</strong></p>

    <p>What&#39;s new? First, read the following documents:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="install.html">Compilation and Installation of Eggdrop</a></li>

        <li><a href="readme.html">Readme</a></li>

        <li><a href="faqs.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li>

        <li><a href="botnet.html">Botnet Sharing and Linking</a></li>

        <li>Changes1.6</li>

        <li><a href="tcl-commands.html">Eggdrop Tcl Commands</a></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p>All of these documents combined will help fill you in on the latest
    changes to Eggdrop in version 1.6.x.</p>

    <p>A lot of things have changed in this version, so at a minimum, read
    the Changes1.6 text file. Changes shows what&#39;s been added and fixed
    along the way.</p>

    <p><strong>If you are upgrading from a pre-1.6 version of Eggdrop:</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Before you start the bot for the first time, <strong>BACKUP</strong>
          your userfile.</li>

        <li>
          <strong>DON&#39;T USE YOUR OLD CONFIG FILE. MAKE A NEW ONE!</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Changes made to Eggdrop 1.6.x from Eggdrop1.4.x:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>!Channels</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Support for IRCnet !channels was added to Eggdrop. This might still
      be a bit buggy. We appreciate bug reports!</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>+/-nodesynch</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This new channel setting replaces the old &#39;allow-desync&#39;
      config file setting. It is useful if you use some type of ChanServ
      or if you don&#39;t care about your channel being desynched.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Asynchronous Dns Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop 1.6 is shipped with a new module, the dns module. It
      replaces those old dns-lookups performed by Eggdrop which could halt
      the whole bot during a timeout. We also added a new Tcl command,
      &#39;dnslookup&#39;, so scripts can now use DNS functions
      asynchronously, too. See <a href="mod-dns.html">Dns Module</a> for
      more information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Compress Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>A new module called compress was introduced to Eggdrop. It provides
      gzip support to Eggdrop via Tcl commands and enables compressed
      userfile transfer. See <a href="mod-compress.html">Compress Module</a>
      for more information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Share Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The share module has a new setting now (override-bots) which allows
     hub bots to override the leaf bots&#39; bot settings (botaddress, telnet
     port, and password). Please note that this won&#39;t work with a version
     1.4 or below bot. See <a href="mod-share.html">Share Module</a> for more
     information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Transfer / Filesys Modules</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The filesys and transfer modules have changed completely. Both can
      now handle unlimited filename lengths and description sizes. Incomplete
      downloads from the bot can also now be resumed. The db format of the
      filesys module was changed to remove the limits imposed by the old
      format. There&#39;s nothing special for you to do, as the old db is
      automatically converted to the new format when you first access it.
      You won&#39;t be able to downgrade to older versions after this, so
      you may want to make a backup first. See <a href="mod-transfer.html">
      Transfer Module</a> and  <a href="mod-transfer.html">Filesys Module</a>
      for more information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Uptime Module</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This module reports uptime statistics to
      http://uptime.eggheads.org. Go look and see what your uptime is! It
      takes about 9 hours to show up, so if your bot isn&#39;t listed, try
      again later. See <a href="mod-uptime.html">Uptime Module</a> for more
      information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>DCC Commands</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>&quot;.nick&quot; was renamed to &quot;.handle&quot;.

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>&quot;.chnick&quot; was renamed to &quot;.chhandle&quot;.

        </li>

        <li>

          version 1.8.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>&quot;.modules&quot; now works locally as well as remotely.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Eggdrop now counts all of the traffic which it generates and
          receives through IRC, botnet, scripts, and dcc. You can access
          these statistics via the dcc command &quot;.traffic&quot;. Please
          note that the counter gets reset every time a restart is done.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Channel Modes</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Support for IRCnet negative limits and DALnet&#39;s +R, +M, and +c
      channel modes has been added. Eggdrop now also supports halfops (+h).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Config Files</strong></p>

     <blockquote>
       <ul>
         <li>
           <p>To support longer nicknames, as some IRC servers do, a new
           &#39;nick-len&#39; setting was added.</p>
         </li>

         <li>
           <p>Eggdrop uses strftime now to support different logfile
           suffixes. The new config file setting is &#39;logfile-suffix&#39;.
           </p>
         </li>

         <li>
           <p>A new &#39;pidfile&#39; setting was added to allow you to
           specify the name of Eggdrop&#39;s pid file.</p>
         </li>

         <li>
           <p>The &#39;strict-servernames&#39; setting was removed.</p>
         </li>
       </ul>
     </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Penalty Calculation</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop calculates penalty points on IRCnet now, so it won&#39;t
      flood itself off anymore.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><strong>Tcl Commands</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The &#39;chnick&#39; command was renamed to &#39;chhandle&#39;.
          The use of &#39;chnick&#39; is deprecated. &#39;chnick&#39; is
          still accessible if you load compat.tcl.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>All three commands to add data to the queues (puthelp, putserv
          and putquick) now support the &#39;-next&#39; parameter which
          pushes data to the front of the queue.</p>
        </li>
