    <blockquote>
      <p>Please read this file carefully before trying to set up Eggdrop.
      Also, make <strong>SURE</strong> that you select your +n (owner) users
      wisely! They have 100% access to your bot and account! <strong>ONLY
      GIVE THIS POWER TO SOMEONE YOU TRUST COMPLETELY!!</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect2"></a>2. <strong>What is Eggdrop?</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop is the World&#39;s most popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC)
      bot; it is freely distributable under the GNU General Public
      License (GPL). Eggdrop is a feature rich program designed to be
      easily used and expanded upon by both novice and advanced IRC
      users on a variety of hardware and software platforms.</p>

      <p>An IRC bot is a program that sits on an IRC channel and performs
      automated tasks while looking just like a normal user on the
      channel. Some of these functions include protecting the channel
      from abuse, allowing privileged users to gain op or voice status,
      logging channel events, providing information, hosting games, etc.</p>

      <p>One of the features that makes Eggdrop stand out from other bots
      is module and Tcl scripting support. With scripts and modules,
      you can make the bot perform almost any task you want. They can
      do anything from preventing floods to greeting users and banning
      advertisers from channels.</p>

      <p>You can also link multiple Eggdrop bots together to form a botnet.
      This can allow bots to op each other securely, control floods
      efficiently, and even link channels across multiple IRC networks.
      It also allows the Eggdrops share user lists, ban lists,
      exempt/invite lists, and ignore lists with other bots if userfile
      sharing is enabled. This allows users to have the same access on
      every bot on your botnet. It also allows the bots to distribute
      tasks such as opping and banning users. See <a href="botnet.html">
      Botnet Sharing and Linking</a> for information on setting up a
      botnet.</p>

      <p>Eggdrop is always being improved and adjusted because there are
      bugs to be fixed and features to be added (if the users demand them,
      and they make actually sense). In fact, it existed for several years
      as v0.7 - v0.9 before finally going 1.0. This version of Eggdrop is
      part of the 1.6 tree. A valiant effort has been made to chase down and
      destroy bugs.</p>

      <p>This readme file contains information about how to get Eggdrop,
      command line options for Eggdrop, what you may need to do when
      upgrading from older versions, a list of frequently asked
      questions, how to set up a crontab, some boring legal stuff, info
      about the mailing list (a great place to ask questions, and a good
      place to report bugs, also), some basics about CVS usage, and some
      channels where you might get help with Eggdrop.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect3"></a>3. <strong>How to get Eggdrop</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Before you can compile Eggdrop, you need to have Tcl installed on
      your system. Most systems should have Tcl on them by now -- you can
      check by trying the command &quot;tclsh&quot;. If it works, you will be
      given a &quot;%&quot; prompt, and you can type &quot;exit&quot; to exit
      the program. This means Tcl is installed on your system. If tclsh
      doesn&#39;t load, then Tcl probably isn&#39;t on your system, and you
      will need to install it. The best ftp site for Tcl is
      <a href="ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/">
      ftp://tcl.activestate.com/pub/tcl/.</a></p>

      <p>Tcl comes with the Slackware distribution of Linux. HOWEVER, the one
      that comes on Slackware 3.0 is goofed up and you&#39;ll have to
      reinstall it for yourself to get it working.</p>

      <p>Currently, the 1.6 tree of Eggdrop is developed at eggheads.org.
      You can get the latest version of Eggdrop from
      <a href="http://geteggdrop.com/">geteggdrop.com</a>.</p>

      <p>You might also try <a href="http://www.eggheads.org/">
      www.eggheads.org</a> for more help and information.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect3a"></a>3a. <strong>How to get the latest version of
    Eggdrop via CVS</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>You can obtain the <strong>very latest</strong> version of Eggdrop,
      that is still under development, by using CVS. CVS means &#39;Concurrent
      Versions System&#39; and is a tool for developers to always keep source
      code up to date. Try &#39;man cvs&#39; on your shell for more
      information about CVS.</p>

      <p>This is intended only for users that know a good bit about Eggdrop.
      Be aware that the versions of Eggdrop that you get via CVS are still
      being developed, and may be buggy. The Eggheads Development Team will
      in <strong>NO WAY</strong> take any responsibility for whatever might
      happen to you or your shell if you use a CVS version of Eggdrop.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>To obtain Eggdrop via CVS:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>Log into your shell.</li>

        <li>Type &#39;export
        CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot&#39;
        .</li>

        <li>Type &#39;cvs login&#39;.</li>

        <li>Press &lt;enter&gt; when prompted for a password.</li>

        <li>In your home dir, type &#39;cvs checkout eggdrop1.6&#39;.</li>

        <li>In ~/eggdrop1.6, you should have a copy of the latest CVS version
        of Eggdrop.</li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Notes:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li>You can &#39;cvs logout&#39;, but you don&#39;t need to.</li>

        <li>You don&#39;t need to go through this whole process every time.
        If you want to get a CVS version of Eggdrop at a later time, you can
        just &#39;cd ~/eggdrop1.6&#39; and type &#39;cvs update -CdAP&#39;.
        </li>

        <li>If you experience errors when using &#39;export&#39;, you might
        be using tclsh as a shell. If so, try using the command
        &#39;setenv&#39; instead of &#39;export&#39;:

          <blockquote>
            <p>&#39;setenv CVSROOT
            :pserver:anonymous@cvs.eggheads.org:/usr/local/cvsroot&#39;
            </p>
          </blockquote>
        </li>

    <p><a name="sect4"></a>4. <strong>Quick startup</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Please see <a href="install.html">Compilation and Installation of
      Eggdrop</a> <strong> AFTER</strong> you finish reading this file.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect5"></a>5. <strong>Upgrading</strong></p>

    <p><a name="sect5a"></a>5a. <strong>Upgrading from a pre-1.3 version to
    1.6</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>BACK UP YOUR USERFILE</strong></p>

      <p>We can&#39;t stress this enough. If you are upgrading and you have
      even a slight possibility of downgrading again later, you will
      <strong>HAVE</strong> to back up your userfile, or you will lose it.
      v1.3 of Eggdrop radically changed a lot of things.</p>

      <p>There are many major changes between v0.9, v1.0, v1.1 and
      v1.6, so <strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong> to this part if you have
      a v0.9, 1.0 or 1.1 bot currently. If you&#39;re just starting out,
      you can skip this section.</p>

      <p>If you run share bots, you will need to upgrade
      them all at the same time because of the new userfile format. Older
      bots will be able to link in, but will not get or send a userfile.
      <strong>MAKE A NEW CONFIG FILE</strong> from the example; there are
      some radical changes.</p>

      <p>If you are upgrading from 0.9/1.0 to 1.6, just redo the whole thing.
      Absolutely everything has changed, including the userfile and config
      file formats.</p>

      <p>If you are upgrading from 1.1/1.2 to 1.6, you will likely want to
      redo the config file, as much as changed. <strong>BACK UP!</strong>
      You will need to run &#39;tclsh scripts/weed/&lt;userfile&gt; c&#39;
      to convert your userfile from v3 (1.1/1.2) to v4 (1.3/1.4/1.5/1.6).</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect5b"></a>5b. <strong>Upgrading from an older 1.3/1.4/1.5/
    1.6 version to a newer 1.6 version</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If you followed <a href="install.html">Compilation and
      Installation of Eggdrop</a> and did a &#39;make install&#39; (or
      &#39;make install DEST=&quot;path&quot;&#39;) after &#39;make&#39;,
      this will be pretty easy. Just upload the new eggdrop1.6.x.tar.gz file
      to your home dir on your shell, gunzip and untar it, and type &#39;cd
      ~/eggdrop1.6.x&#39;. Next, type &#39;./configure&#39;, &#39;make
      config&#39; or &#39;make iconfig&#39;, then &#39;make&#39;. Then, kill
      the bot (&#39;.die&#39; on the party line), and &#39;make install&#39;
      to the same directory your bot is currently in. After that, you can
      just restart your bot. You may wish to delete the old Eggdrop executable
      and modules as well, especially if you have limited disk space.</p>

      <p>You should read through the new eggdrop.conf file for all of the new
      options in Eggdrop 1.6.x if you are upgrading from 1.3.x or 1.4.x. You
      can copy and paste any of these settings into you current conf file if
      you do not want to use the default settings.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect6"></a>6. <strong>Command line</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop has some command-line options -- not many, because most
      things should be defined through the config file. However, sometimes
      you may want to start up the bot in a different mode, and the
      command-line options let you do that. Basically, the command line for
      Eggdrop is:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><em>% eggdrop [options] [config-file]</em></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The options available are:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <dl>
          <dt><strong>-n</strong></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Don&#39;t background. Normally, Eggdrop will move itself into
            the background when you start it up, meaning you&#39;ll get another
            shell prompt, and you can do other things while the bot is running.
            With -n, you won&#39;t return to the shell prompt until the bot
            exits (which won&#39;t normally happen until it&#39;s killed). By
            default, -n will send all log entries to the console.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><strong>-nt</strong></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Don&#39;t background, use terminal. This is just like -n, except
            that instead of seeing log entries, your console will simulate a
            DCC chat with the bot.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><strong>-nc</strong></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Don&#39;t background, show channel info. This is just like -n,
            except that instead of seeing log entries, every 10 seconds your
            screen will clear and you will see the current channel status, sort
            of like &quot;top&quot;.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><strong>-m</strong></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Create userfile. If you don&#39;t have a userfile, this will
            make Eggdrop create one and give owner status to the first person
            that introduces himself or herself to it. You&#39;ll need to do
            this when you first set up your bot.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><strong>-h</strong></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Show help.</p>
          </dd>

          <dt><strong>-v</strong></dt>

          <dd>
            <p>Show version info, then quit.</p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Most people never use any of the options except -m, and you usually
      only need to use that once.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect7"></a>7. <strong>Setting up a crontab</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Eggdrop has become more stable with time, thanks mostly to people
      reporting bug details and helping find places where it crashes.
      However, there are still a -few- places where things aren&#39;t
      perfect. Few, if any, things in life are.</p>

      <p>Also, most systems go down from time to time. These things cause
      your bot to disappear from IRC, and you have to restart it.</p>

      <p>Eggdrop comes with a shell script called &#39;botchk&#39; that
      will help keep the bot online. It will make the machine check every
      ten minutes to make sure your bot is still running. To use it, you
      have to add a line to your crontab. First, edit &#39;botchk&#39; and
      change the directory and command line parameters so that it will be
      able to start up your bot. Then, add this line to your crontab:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If you don&#39;t want to get e-mails from cron, use this:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>0,10,20,30,40,50 * * * * /home/mydir/botchk &gt;/dev/null
        2&gt;&amp;1</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Naturally, you need to change the path to the correct path for
      botchk. If you&#39;ve never used crontab before, here is a simple way
      to add that line:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li> Create a new file called &#39;mycron&#39; and put the above
          line into it.</li>

          <li>From your shell prompt, type &#39;% crontab mycron&#39;.
        </ol>

        <p>That will create a new crontab entry for you with a line that
        runs botchk every ten minutes. Botchk will then restart the bot when
        necessary (and send you email informing you).</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>

    <p><a name="sect7a"></a>7a. <strong>Setting up a crontab using
    autobotchk</strong></p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Included with your Eggdrop is a utility called &#39;autobotchk&#39;.
      Using autobotchk is probably the fastest way of creating your botchk
      and adding it to crontab with just a few required steps:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>Type &#39;cp scripts/autobotchk ..&#39;.</li>

          <li>Type &#39;./autobotchk &lt;Eggdrop config file&gt;&#39;.</li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>

      <p>This will hopefully crontab your bot using the default setup. If you
      want a list of autobotchk options, type &#39;./autobotchk&#39;. An
      example with options would be:</p>

      <p>./autobotchk eggdrop.conf -noemail -5</p>

      <p>This would setup crontab to run the botchk every 5 minutes and also
      to not send you e-mail saying that it restarted your bot.</p>
