    <blockquote>
      <p>The first line in an Eggdrop configuration file should contain
      a fully qualified path to your Eggdrop executable. It has to be
      implemented in the way the example shows to make the config file
      work as a shell script.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>

      <p>#! /path/to/eggdrop</p>

          <p>This setting defines the username the bot uses on IRC. This

        <dt><strong>set timezone &quot;EST&quot;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This setting defines which timezone is your bot in. It&#39;s
          used for internal routines as well as for logfile timestamping
          and scripting purposes. The timezone string specifies the name of
          the timezone and must be three or more alphabetic characters. For
          example, Central European Time(UTC+1) should be &quot;CET&quot;.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set offset &quot;5&quot;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>The offset setting specifies the time value to be added to the
          local time to get Coordinated Universal Time (UTC aka GMT). The
          offset is positive if the local timezone is west of the Prime
          Meridian and negative if it is east. The value (in hours) must be
          between -23 and 23. For example, if the timezone is UTC+1, the
          offset is -1.</p>

        default)</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you don&#39;t want to use the timezone setting for scripting
          purposes only, but instead everywhere possible, then use this
          setting.</p>

          <p>If you&#39;re using virtual hosting (your machine has more
          than 1 IP), you may want to specify the particular IP to bind to.
          You can specify either by hostname or by IP. You may also want to
          set the hostname here if Eggdrop has trouble detecting it when it
          starts up.</p>

          <p>If you want to have your Eggdrop messages displayed in another
          language, change this command to match your preferences. An
          alternative would be to set the environment variable EGG_LANG to
          that value.</p>

    <p><a name="sect1c"></a>1c. <strong>Log files</strong></p>

    <p>Eggdrop is capable of logging various things, from channel chatter to
    partyline commands and file transfers.</p>

    <p>Logfiles are normally kept for 24 hours. Afterwards, they will be
    renamed to &quot;(logfilename).yesterday&quot;. After 48 hours, they
    will be overwritten be the logfile of the next day.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>set max-logs 5</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This is the maximum number of logfiles allowed. This setting
          can be increased; however, don&#39;t decrease it.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-logsize 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This is the maximum size of your logfiles. Set it to 0 to
          disable. This value is in kilobytes, so &#39;550&#39; would mean
          cycle logs when it reaches the size of 550 kilobytes. Note that
          this only works if you have keep-all-logs set to 0 (OFF).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set quick-logs 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This could be good if you have had a problem with logfiles
          filling your quota/hard disk or if you log +p and publish it
          to the web, and you need more up-to-date info. Note that this
          setting might increase the CPU usage of your bot (on the other
          hand it will decrease your RAM usage).</p>

        &quot;logs/logfile&quot;</strong></dt>

          <p>Note that modes d, h, r, t, and v can fill disk quotas quickly.
          There are also eight user-defined levels (1-8) which can be used by
          Tcl scripts.</p>

          <p>Each logfile belongs to a certain channel. Events of type
          &#39;k&#39;, &#39;j&#39;, and &#39;p&#39; are logged to whatever
          channel they happened on. Most other events are currently logged
          to every channel. You can make a logfile belong to all channels
          by assigning it to channel &quot;*&quot;</p>

          <p>Examples:</p>

          <p><strong>logfile mco * &quot;logs/eggdrop.log&quot;<br>
          logfile jpk #lamest &quot;logs/lamest.log&quot;<br></strong></p>

          <p>In &#39;eggdrop.log&#39;, put private msgs/ctcps, commands,
          misc info, and errors from any channel.</p>

          <p>In &#39;lamest.log&#39;, log all joins, parts, kicks, bans,
          public chatter, and mode changes from #lamest.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set log-time 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Use this feature to timestamp entries in the log file.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set timestamp-format &quot;[%H:%M:%S]&quot;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set the following to the timestamp for the logfile entries.
          Popular times might be "[%H:%M]" (hour,min), or "[%H:%M:%S]"
          (hour, min, sec). Read `man strftime' for more formatting
          options. Keep it below 32 chars.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set keep-all-logs 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you want to keep your logfiles forever, turn this setting
          on. All logfiles will get the suffix ".[day, 2 digits][month, 3
          letters][year, 4 digits]". Note that your quota/hard-disk might
          be filled by this, so check your logfiles often and download
          them.</p>

        <dt><strong>set switch-logfiles-at 300</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>You can specify when Eggdrop should switch logfiles and start
          fresh. You must use military time for this setting. 300 is the

          and &quot;Backing up channel file...&quot; messages will also not be
          logged. In addition to this, you can disable the &quot;Switching
          logfiles...&quot; and the new date message at midnight, by setting
          this to 3.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set logfile-suffix &quot;.%d%b%Y&quot;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If keep-all-logs is 1, this setting will define the suffix of
          the logfiles. The default will result in a suffix like
          &quot;04May2000&quot;. &quot;%Y%m%d&quot; will produce the often
          used yyyymmdd format. Read the strftime manpages for more options.
          NOTE: On systems which don&#39;t support strftime, the default

    <p>Settings in this section should be unimportant for you until you
    deal with botnets (multiple Eggdrops connected together to maximize
    efficiency). You should read <a href="botnet.html">Botnet Sharing and
    Linking</a> before modifying these settings.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>set botnet-nick &quot;LlamaBot&quot;</strong> (disabled
        by default)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you want to use a different nickname on the botnet than you
          use on IRC (i.e. if you&#39;re on an un-trusted botnet), un-comment
          this line and set it to the nick you would like to use.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>listen &lt;port&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This opens a telnet port by which you and other bots can interact
          with the Eggdrop by telneting in.</p>

          <p>There are more options for the listen command in
          <a href="tcl-commands.html">Tcl Commands</a>. Note that if you are
          running more than one bot on the same machine, you will want to space
          the telnet ports at LEAST 5 apart, although 10 is even better.</p>

          <p>Valid ports are typically anything between 1025 and 65535 assuming
          the port is not already in use.</p>

          <p>If you would like the bot to listen for users and bots in separate
          ports, use the following format:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>listen 3333 bots</strong><br>
            <strong>listen 4444 users</strong></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>If you wish to use only one port, use this format:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><strong>listen 3333 all</strong></p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>You need to un-comment this line and change the port number in
          order to open the listen port. You should not keep this set to
          3333.</p>

      are needed. Four examples:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Channel Security Bot</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This bot needs the channels, blowfish, console, dns, irc, and

          the bot slower.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Public IRC Bot</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A public bot should have all modules available loaded since
          they provide all functions for everyday use.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Secure Filesys Bot</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This bot needs all normal IRC operating modules, but not the
          notes, seen, ctcp or share modules.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>Limbo Bot</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>A limbo bot (serves as a botnet hub outside IRC) just needs the
          channels, console, dns, and maybe notes or share modules loaded.
          Of course, blowfish needs to be loaded here, too.</p>

      <p>The scripts section should be placed at the end of the config file.

      <p><strong>source scripts/script.tcl</strong></p>

      <p>This line loads script.tcl from the scripts directory inside your
      Eggdrop&#39;s directory. All scripts should be put there, although you
      can place them where you like as long as you can supply a fully
