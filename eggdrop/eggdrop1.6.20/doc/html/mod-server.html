      <p>This module provides the core server support. You have to load this
      if you want your bot to come on IRC.<br>

      <p>Put this line into your Eggdrop configuration file to load the
      server module:</p>

      <p>There are also some variables you can set in your config

          from a server. It is limited to 120 characters, and is depriciated

</pre>
        <p><strong>}</strong></p>


        <dd>
          <p>This is the bot&#39;s server list. The bot will start at the first
          server listed, and cycle through them whenever it gets disconnected.
          You need to change these servers to YOUR network&#39;s servers.</p>

          <p>For example:</p>

          <p>set servers {<br>
           &nbsp; irc.netw.ork<br>
           &nbsp; irc.krow.ten:6668<br>
           }</p>

           <p>The format is: server[:port[:password]]</p>

           <p>Both the port and password fields are optional; however, if you
           want to set a password you must also set a port. If a port isn&#39;t
           specified it will default to  your default-port setting..</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set default-port 6667</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set the default port which should be used if none is specified
          with &#39;.jump&#39; or in &#39;set servers&#39;.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set msg-rate 2</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Number of seconds to wait between transmitting queued lines to
          the server. Lower this value at your own risk.  ircd is known to
          start flood control at 512 bytes/2 seconds.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set server-cycle-wait 60</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This setting defines how long Eggdrop should wait before moving
          from one server to another on disconnect. If you set 0 here,
          Eggdrop will not wait at all and will connect instantly. Setting
          this too low could result in your bot being K:Lined.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set never-give-up 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This settings makes the bot cycle forever through the server
          list until it successfully connects to one.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set server-timeout 60</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here how long Eggdrop should wait for a response when
          connecting to a server before giving up and moving on to next
          server.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set servlimit 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If the number of servers on the net gets below this number,
          the bot will jump to a new server (it will assume it&#39;s on the
          losing end of a netsplit). Set this to 0 to turn off. If your
          bot is running on any major IRC network, this should probably
          be turned off.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set check-stoned 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set this to 1 if Eggdrop should check for stoned servers? (where
          the server connection has died, but Eggdrop hasn&#39;t been notified
          yet).</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set serverror-quit 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you want your bot to exit the server if it receives an
          ERROR message, set this to 1.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set max-queue-msg 300</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here the maximum number of lines to queue to the server.
          If you&#39;re going to dump large chunks of text to people over IRC,
          you will probably want to raise this. 300 is fine for most people
          though.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set raw-log 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This setting allows you the logging of raw incoming server
          traffic via console/log flag &#39;r&#39;, raw outgoing server
          traffic via console/log mode &#39;v&#39;, raw botnet traffic via
          console/log mode &#39;t&#39;, and raw share traffic via console/log
          mode &#39;h&#39;. These flags can create a large security hole,
          allowing people to see user passwords. This is now restricted to +n
          users only. Please choose your owners with care.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set quiet-reject 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This setting makes the bot squelch the error message when
          rejecting a DCC CHAT, SEND or message command. Normally,
          Eggdrop notifies the user that the command has been rejected
          because they don&#39;t have access. Note that sometimes IRC
          server operators detect bots that way.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set flood-msg 5:60</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here how many msgs in how many seconds from one host
          constitutes a flood. If you set this to 0:0, msg flood protection
          will be disabled.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set flood-ctcp 3:60</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set here how many ctcps in how many seconds from one host are
          recognized as a flood. Not specifying or using number = 0
          will not check against ctcp floods.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set answer-ctcp 3</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Set how many ctcps should be answered at once here.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set lowercase-ctcp 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you want your bot to answer lower case ctcp requests (non
          rfc-compliant), set this setting to 1. mIRC will do this, most
          other clients will not.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set trigger-on-ignore 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>If you want Eggdrop to trigger binds for ignored users, set
          this to 1.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set exclusive-binds 0</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This setting configures PUBM and MSGM binds to be exclusive
          of PUB and MSG binds. This means if a MSGM bind with the mask
          &quot;*help*&quot; exists and is triggered, any MSG bindings
          with &quot;help&quot; in their mask will not be triggered.
          Don&#39;t enable this unless you know what you are doing!</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set double-mode 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Allow identical messages in the mode queue?</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set double-server 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Allow identical messages in the server queue?</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set double-help 0</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>Allow identical messages in the help queue?</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set use-penalties 1</strong></dt>

        <dt>(default on net-type 1)</dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This enables Eggdrop&#39;s penalty calculation. Every command
          Eggdrop sends to the IRC server raises it&#39;s penalty points.
          If Eggdrop reaches a server limit, it gets disconnected with
          &quot;excess flood&quot; message. Eggdrop is able to count internal
          those penalty points, too and take measures against excess flooding.
          Note: it&#39;s highly advised to turn this on!</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set optimize-kicks 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This optimizes the kick queue. It also traces nick changes
          and parts in the channel and changes the kick queue accordingly.
          There are three different options for this setting:</p>

          <p>0 = Turn it off.<br>
           1 = Optimize the kick queue by summarizing kicks.<br>
           2 = Trace nick changes and parts on the channel and change
           the queue accordingly. For example, bot will not try to kick
           users who have already parted the channel.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>There are more settings for &#39;net-type&#39; 5.</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>set check-mode-r 1</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This settings defines how umode +r is understood by Eggdrop.
          Some networks use +r to indicate a restricted connection. If this
          is your case, and you want your bot to leave restricted servers
          and jump to the next server on its list, then set it to 1. Please
          note, this setting is automatically set to 0 for net-type 0/2/3/4,
          and set to 1 for net-type 1.</p>
        </dd>

        <dt><strong>set nick-len 9</strong></dt>

        <dd>
          <p>This setting allows you to specify the maximum nick-length
          supported by your network. The default setting is 9. The
          maximum supported length by Eggdrop is 32.</p>
