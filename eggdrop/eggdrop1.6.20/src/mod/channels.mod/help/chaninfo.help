###  %bchaninfo%b <channel>
     This lists all the settings for the bot on the given channel.
     It shows any of the following:
        %bchanmode%b   These modes are enforced on the channel. Both + and -
                   modes can be enforced.
        %bidle-kick%b  Kick idle users that are not +f or above on the channel
                   after how many minutes (set this to 0 to disable).
%{+n}
        %bATTENTION:%b Due to security concerns, only permanent owners can set
                   the need-* modes.
        %bneed-op%b      This Tcl command will be executed when the bot doesn't
                     have ops.
        %bneed-invite%b  This Tcl command will be executed when the bot needs
                     an invite to the channel (i.e. the channel is +i).
        %bneed-key%b     This Tcl command will be executed when the bot needs
                     the key to the channel to join.
        %bneed-unban%b   This Tcl command will be executed when the bot needs
                     to be unbanned from the channel to join.
        %bneed-limit%b   This Tcl command will be executed when the bot needs
                     the channel limit to be raised to join.
%{+m|m}
        %bstopnethack-mode%b  This setting will make the bot de-op anyone who
                          enters the channel with serverops. There are seven
                          different modes for this settings:
                            0 turn off
                            1 isoptest (allow serverop if registered op)
                            2 wasoptest (allow serverop if user had op before
                              split)
                            3 allow serverop if isop or wasop
                            4 allow serverop if isop and wasop
                            5 If the channel is -bitch, see stopnethack-mode 3
                              If the channel is +bitch, see stopnethack-mode 1
                            6 If the channel is -bitch, see stopnethack-mode 2
                              If the channel is +bitch, see stopnethack-mode 4
        %brevenge-mode%b      This settings defines how the bot should punish
                          bad users when revenging. There are four possible
                          settings:
                            0 Deop the user.
                            1 Deop the user and give them the +d flag for the
                              channel.
                            2 Deop the user, give them the +d flag for the
                              channel, and kick them.
                            3 Deop the user, give them the +d flag for the
                              channel, kick, and ban them.
        %bban-type%b          This setting defines what type of bans should
                          eggdrop place for +k users or when revenge-mode is 3.
                          Available types are:
                            0 *!user@host
                            1 *!*user@host
                            2 *!*@host
                            3 *!*user@*.host
                            4 *!*@*.host
                            5 nick!user@host
                            6 nick!*user@host
                            7 nick!*@host
                            8 nick!*user@*.host
                            9 nick!*@*.host
                          You can also specify types from 10 to 19 which
                          correspond to types 0 to 9, but instead of using a *
                          wildcard to replace portions of the host, only
                          numbers in hostnames are replaced with the '?'
                          wildcard. Same is valid for types 20-29, but instead
                          of '?', the '*' wildcard will be used.
        %bban-time%b          Set here how long temporary bans will last (in
                          minutes). If you set this setting to 0, the bot will
                          never remove them.
        %bexempt-time%b       Set here how long temporary exempts will last (in
                          minutes). If you set this setting to 0, the bot will
                          never remove them. The bot will check the exempts
                          every X minutes, but will not remove the exempt if a
                          ban is set on the channel that matches that exempt.
                          Once the ban is removed, then the exempt will be
                          removed the next time the bot checks. Please note
                          that this is an IRCnet feature.
        %binvite-time%b       Set here how long temporary invites will last (in
                          minutes). If you set this setting to 0, the bot will
                          never remove them. The bot will check the invites
                          every X minutes, but will not remove the invite if a
                          channel is set to +i. Once the channel is -i then the
                          invite will be removed the next time the bot checks.
                          Please note that this is an IRCnet feature.
        %baop-delay%b         This is used for autoop, autohalfop, autovoice.
                          If an op or voice joins a channel while another op or
                          voice is pending, the bot will attempt to put both
                          modes on one line.
                            aop-delay 0   No delay is used.
                            aop-delay X   An X second delay is used.
                            aop-delay X:Y Random delay between X and Y is used.
     The following can be set + or - (e.g. .chanset #channel -enforcebans)
        %benforcebans%b    When a ban is set, kick people who are on the channel
                       and match the ban?
        %bdynamicbans%b    Only activate bans on the channel when necessary?
                       This keeps the channel's ban list from getting
                       excessively long. The bot still remembers every ban,
                       but it only activates a ban on the channel when it sees
                       someone join who matches that ban.
        %buserbans%b       Allow bans to be made by users directly? If turned
                       off, the bot will require all bans to be made through
                       the bot's console.
        %bdynamicexempts%b Only activate exempts on the channel when
                       necessary? This keeps the channel's exempt list from
                       getting excessively long. The bot still remembers every
                       exempt, but it only activates a exempt on the channel
                       when it sees a ban set that matches the exempt. The
                       exempt remains active on the channel for as long as the
                       ban is still active.
        %buserexempts%b    Allow exempts to be made by users directly? If
                       turned off, the bot will require all exempts to be made
                       through the bot's console.
        %bdynamicinvites%b Only activate invites on the channel when necessary?
                       This keeps the channel's invite list from getting
                       excessively long. The bot still remembers every invite,
                       but the invites are only activated when the channel is
                       set to invite only and a user joins after requesting an
                       invite. Once set, the invite remains until the channel
                       goes to -i.
        %buserinvites%b    Allow invites to be made by users directly? If turned
                       off, the bot will require all invites to be made through
                       the bot's console.
        %bautoop%b         Op users with the +o flag as soon as they join the
                       channel? This is insecure and not recommended.
        %bautohalfop%b     Halfop users with the +l flag as soon as they join
                       the channel? This is insecure and not recommended.
        %bbitch%b          Only let users with the +o flag have op on the
                       channel?
        %bgreet%b          Say a user's info line when they join the channel?
        %bprotectops%b     Re-op a user with the +o flag if they get deopped?
        %bprotecthalfops%b Re-halfop a user with the +l flag if they get
                       dehalfopped?
        %bprotectfriends%b Re-op a user with the +f flag if they get deopped?
        %bstatuslog%b      Log the channel status line every 5 minutes? This
                       shows the bot's status on the channel (op, voice, etc.),
                       the channel's modes, and the number of +m, +o, +v, +n,
                       +b, +e, and +I users on the channel. A sample status
                       line follows:

                         [01:40] @#chan (+istn) : [m/1 o/1 v/4 n/7 b/1 e/5 I/7]
        %brevenge%b        Remember people who deop/kick/ban the bot, valid ops,
                       or friends and punish them? Users with the +f flag are
                       exempt from revenge.
        %brevengebot%b     This is similar to to the 'revenge' option, but it
                       only triggers if a bot gets deopped, kicked or banned.
        %bautovoice%b      Voice users with the +v flag when they join the
                       channel?
        %bsecret%b         Prevent this channel from being listed on the botnet?
        %bshared%b         Share channel-related user info for this channel?
        %bcycle%b          Cycle the channel when it has no ops?
        %bdontkickops%b    Do you want the bot not to be able to kick users who
                       have the +o flag, letting them kick-flood for instance
                       to protect the channel against clone attacks?
        %binactive%b       This prevents the bot from joining the channel (or
                       makes it leave the channel if it is already there). It
                       can be useful to make the bot leave a channel without
                       losing its settings, channel-specific user flags,
                       channel bans, and without affecting sharing.
        %bseen%b           Respond to seen requests in the channel?  The seen
                       module must be loaded for this to work.
        %bnodesynch%b      Allow non-ops to perform channel modes? This can stop
                       the bot from fighting with services such as ChanServ, or
                       from kicking IRCops when setting channel modes without
                       having ops.
        %bstatic%b         Allow only permanent owners to remove the channel?
     The following are flood settings, they are set via ".chanset <channel>
     flood-type number:seconds", where number and second are integers
     indicating the number of times in how many seconds the flood will be
     triggered. Setting one of these to 0:0, 0:1, or 1:0 will deactivate the
     respective flood setting.
        %bflood-chan%b  Set here how many channel messages in how many seconds
                    from one host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0
                    disables text flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-ctcp%b  Set here how many channel ctcps in how many seconds from
                    one host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0
                    disables ctcp flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-join%b  Set here how many joins in how many seconds from one
                    host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0 disables
                    join flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-kick%b   Set here how many kicks in how many seconds from one
                    host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0 disables
                    kick flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-deop%b   Set here how many deops in how many seconds from one
                    host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0 disables
                    deop flood protection for the channel.
        %bflood-nick%b   Set here how many nick changes in how many seconds from
                    one host constitutes a flood. Setting this to 0 or 0:0
                    disables nick flood protection for the channel.
