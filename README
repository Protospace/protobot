In here are the various bots we are working on and stealing from. The actual channel bot runs from protobot.

Both tablecat (protobot) and eggdrop have dependancies:

eggdrop : tcl

tablecat :     * Python-Twitter (note: as of writing the one in ubuntu repos will not work)
               * Oyoyo IRC library 

                Both of these have multiple subdependancies.
