Commands are as follows:

!tweet <something> :: something gets tweeted
!soapself <something> :: bot auths self to nickserv. the msg cannot be empty, but the content is meaningless. This will be fixed.

Future command will allow passing of commands via msg, and passing arbitrary commands to nickserv.
